* Size: number of rows
* Columns: number of variables per rows
* Cell: a pair (row, column)
* Witness: the values assigned in all the cells
* Gate: polynomials that act on the variables in a row
* Selector vector: a vector of values 1 or 0 (not true for constant vector I think) that toggles gates and variables in a row
* Gadget: a series of contiguous rows with some specific gates set (via selector vectors)
